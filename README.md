# The Ferus Web Engine
The Ferus Web Engine is a new toy web engine written in the Nim programming language, built with the following goals:
- being (relatively) simple to understand
- being as secure as possible with sandboxing
- using Nim as much as possible

It is far from completion as of right now. The browser right now is going through a phase of rewriting and architectural changes underway.
Hold tight!
